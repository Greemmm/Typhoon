These tragedies occur when there are favorable conditions, such as warm sea temperatures. We are highly vulnerable to typhoons. More than 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year. The Philippines are prone to typhoons due to their geographical placement in "The Pacific Ring of Fire" and proximity to the Pacific Ocean. More powerful typhoons are projected as a result of recent climate changes. This website aims to raise awareness about these disasters and provide information on the potential harm caused by typhoons.</h2><br><br>
          
            <h3>"Super Typhoon Karding" is an example of a typhoon that inflicted significant damage. This typhoon inflicted extensive damage to the island of Luzon. Numerous homes and lives have been destroyed.</h3><br><br>

            <h7><br>Karding caused widespread destruction across the country. With peak winds of (235-255 km/h), the typhoon undoubtedly inflicted significant damage. This caused the typhoon to have massive repercussions across its route. Warm sea temperatures helped Typhoon Noru gather power and intensify. Noru's connection with the warm water of the ocean helps it to gain additional power while maintaining its intensity. The high pressure functions as a steering mechanism, directing the typhoon's direction and influencing its speed. The typhoon also inflicted severe damage on the Philippine mainland. Central Luzon, NCR (Metro Manila), Calabarzon, and the Bicol Region have suffered the most damage.</h7>
                <br><br><br>
 <h8>According to some reports, there have been numerous reports of deaths, casualties, missing persons, and injuries as a result of Super Typhoon Karding. As of October 1, 2022, 911,404 individuals were affected in regions 1, 2, 3, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, Region 5, and CAR. With more than 53,000 people still affected, the number of open evacuation facilities has shrunk to 36, with 5,350 people seeking temporary shelter in those sites. According to government statistics, the storm killed 12 people, left 6 people missing, and injured 52 others. As a result of the Super Typhoon's impact, more than 56,900 houses were damaged. Yes the typhoon has been accompanied by secondary disasters such as (landslides,flooding,power outages and Infrastructure damage.) The disasters were crucially impacted on the communities, overwhelming homes, buildings, blocking roads and communication– forcing evacuations to safer level areas.</h8>
<br><br><br>
<h8>Before the Typhoon, the community decided to take emergency measures such as raising storm signals, issuing flood warnings and evacuating vulnerable areas being the preparations against Typhoon Noru. After that, they had concentrated on recovery through the process of the damages, repairing the buildings, providing reassurance in family needs and environmental issues. Having the assistance from the government departments. </h8>

                <h7><br>By developing a disaster plan, we will be able to devise plans and solutions before, during, and after a typhoon.</h7>
                <br><br>
                <h7><br>Create a simple plan like this: </h7>
                <br><br>
                <h7><br>Before: Stocking up on supplies, checking your electronics, staying up to current on the typhoon's progress, and checking your home. Evacuate as needed.</h7>
                <br><br>
                <h7><br>During: Staying indoors, preparing an emergency kit, and keeping an eye on Typhoon Update.</h7>
                <br><br>
                <h7><br>After: Check for damages, guarantee your family's safety, properly dispose of waste, clean up, and seek medical/professional assistance if necessary.</h7>
                <br><br>
                <h7><br>By doing these plans, we are able to ensure safety in the community and in the country. Ensuring the safety of one another, preparing for the Typhoon, and making a safe community for each and every one of us.</h7>

            <br><h9><b>Project Iwas Bagyo(PIB)</b><br>
By proposing safety or enjoyable activities that provide preparedness for the people and some activities that also help reduce the effects of the typhoons. Enjoyable activities that are related to the way of preparing for a typhoon such as making preparations fun for engagement from the people. And activities to reduce Typhoons such planting trees or taking care of the environment.
</h9><br><br><br>
                <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h10>These activities will ensure the safety of the community and provide engagement to our people. Making preparations “Fun” or “Enjoyable” for the community. This also makes the community engage more on these activities that will be safe and provide preparedness. </h10>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h11>Another set of activities are activities that will reduce the risk of Typhoons. One example is the planting of Trees that will reduce the global temperatures. The trees will also provide safety on floods and huge rains. Trees will also make a long impact.</h11>
